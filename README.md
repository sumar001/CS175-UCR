## SkyCity Real Estate

### Overview:

60% of the Millennials wanting to buy a property are unable to fork out the high down payment costs. We SkyCity real Estate are building a platform that connects real-estate investors with each other, allowing them to fractionally invest in residential properties. We will not only be connecting investors, but also helping them in closing deals by doing the leg work - only at a 3% commission.

Mainstreaming the concept of fractional investment, along with offering premium services such as house staging will give us an edge over our competitors as no company currently offers these services under one roof.

The real estate market is strongly gaining back its momentum after the Covid pandemic, making it an ideal time to invest in. To make sure investors don't lose out in this hot market, we will be networking and advertising our startup at the MailCon convention in New York this year. Along with target advertisements through social media platforms.
